//! Player movement against the voxel grid.
//!
//! Collision is resolved **one axis at a time**. Resolving all three together
//! and pushing out along the shallowest overlap is the usual shortcut, and it
//! is what produces the snagging on flat walls that makes voxel movement feel
//! bad: sliding along a wall catches on every block seam. Moving and resolving
//! each axis independently means a blocked axis stops while the others keep
//! going, which is what "sliding along a wall" actually is.
//!
//! Lives in `vx-world` rather than the app so it stays on the simulation side
//! of the networking seam, and so it can be tested without a window.
//!
//! # Why the body is `f64`
//!
//! Everything here is a box measured against a lattice of unit cubes, with
//! two tolerances: [`SKIN`], a millimetre, and [`INSET`], a hundredth of
//! that. In `f32` an absolute coordinate at sixteen kilometres has a step of
//! two millimetres — bigger than the skin — so a body snapped flush to a block
//! face rounds *into* the face, and the next tick finds it overlapping and
//! refuses to let it move. That is fifty minutes' walk from spawn. In `f64`
//! the same step is a few picometres out past anything the `i32` block lattice
//! can name, and the tolerances mean what they say everywhere. The player is
//! the one thing in the game that travels, so the player is the one thing
//! that costs the extra four bytes an axis.
//!
//! # What this file does not know
//!
//! Stamina, stance, cargo, skills and the shop. This answers exactly one
//! question — given a box, a velocity and a tick, where does it end up and what
//! did it touch — and [`MoveParams`] carries the numbers that shape the answer
//! without carrying any reason for them. The state machine that picks those
//! numbers lives in `vx-app` with the rest of the fiction, the same line that
//! keeps `vx-agent` free of quests and economy.

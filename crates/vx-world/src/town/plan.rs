//! What a town is built of: authored blueprints, stamped at a site.
//!
//! Buildings are ASCII layer grids — the cheapest authoring format a human can
//! edit in place and a test can reason about. Layer `i` sits at
//! `site.ground + i`; layer 0 *replaces* the surface block, so floors and
//! paving land on the ground rather than hovering over it. Rows run +z from a
//! blueprint's `min`, characters run +x, and every offset is **relative to the
//! town centre** — which is what lets one set of `&'static` blueprints stamp at
//! any site on the lattice without allocating.
//!
//! Doors and windows are gaps in the wall grid. Nothing is carved afterwards.

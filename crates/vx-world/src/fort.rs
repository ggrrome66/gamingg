//! Star forts: walls with the receipts to justify them.
//!
//! # Why the shape is the shape
//!
//! A bastioned trace is not decoration. Tall thin walls exist to stop ladders;
//! once cannon exist they simply fall down, so the answer is low, thick and
//! *angled* — every face of the wall covered by the guns of another face, and
//! no dead ground anywhere along it where an attacker can stand unseen. The
//! star is what falls out of "no re-entrant angle may go unwatched", and it
//! belongs in this game because stage 13 gave the frontier something to shoot
//! with.
//!
//! # The trace is a polar radius, which makes the wall a signed distance
//!
//! Authoring a fort as a loop of points would mean carrying that loop into
//! every chunk that touches it. Instead the trace is a function of angle:
//!
//! ```text
//! r(θ) = base + bastion · cos(points · θ + phase)
//! ```
//!
//! …so "how far is this column from the wall" is `hypot(dx, dz) - r(θ)` — one
//! cheap expression, pure in `(seed, position)`, needing no cross-chunk
//! context. Wall, walk, parapet and ditch are then bands of that one signed
//! distance, exactly the way the design note asked for.
//!
//! # Gates, and gaps
//!
//! Roads leave a town along the four cardinal axes, so gates sit where the
//! roads already run and the trace opens for them. Each gate is a claim with
//! a lockbox like any other door, which the permits system needed nothing new
//! to handle. And some forts are ruins: a deterministic pass drops whole
//! segments of wall, because a perfect wall is a worse story than a broken
//! one — and because a breach is the thing a player actually remembers.

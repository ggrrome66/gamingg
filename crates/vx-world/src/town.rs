//! Towns: where the frontier is settled.
//!
//! A town is a flat plot with a plan stamped on it. Sites come from a jittered
//! lattice — the same idiom as [`crate::ore`]'s deposits and [`crate::flora`]'s
//! trees — so **the map of towns is derivable arithmetic, never stored**.
//! Asking "where are the towns within five kilometres" costs a few hundred
//! hashes and touches no chunk, which is what lets a beacon post work at a
//! town that has never been generated.
//!
//! # The height field must not feed itself
//!
//! A site is chosen partly by how flat and how dry its ground is, so siting
//! reads the terrain — and the terrain, once a town exists, has that town's
//! plateau flattened into it. Read the blended field while siting and town N's
//! plateau decides where town N+1 stands; siting stops being a pure function of
//! the seed and starts depending on which town happened to be considered first.
//! That is why [`crate::gen::TerrainGenerator`] carries two height functions and
//! siting may only ever see `natural_height_at`.
//!
//! # The site list is a superset contract
//!
//! Every function here that takes `sites: &[TownSite]` answers for a column
//! *given those sites*. Callers must have gathered over a box containing every
//! column they will ask about — exactly the contract [`crate::ore::ore_at`]
//! has with `deposits_overlapping`. Honour it and the answer for a column is
//! identical no matter which chunk asked; break it and chunk seams disagree.

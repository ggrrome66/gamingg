//! Drone swarms: what needs digging, how to reach it, and who is doing it.
//!
//! This crate depends on `vx-world` and `vx-core` and **nothing to do with
//! rendering**. That is deliberate and enforced by the manifest rather than by
//! discipline: the swarm has to be testable headlessly and at speed, and the
//! reliable way to keep it that way is to make the alternative unavailable.
//!
//! The pieces, in the order they matter:
//!
//! - [`aabb`] — integer boxes, the unit every job and excavation is described in.
//! - [`flow`] — what a machine that *drives* can and cannot get to. One
//!   breadth-first sweep serves any number of drones.
//! - [`mine`] — adit, decline or open pit: how to open a mine on a body, which
//!   for a ground drone is the same question as how to reach it.
//! - [`job`] — the shared board. Drones take work from it rather than each
//!   planning their own.
//! - [`drone`] — one machine's position, cargo and reach.
//! - [`operation`] — the tick that turns a plan into a hole in the ground.
//! - [`prospect`] — finding ore: by eye, and by the scanner's column walk.
//! - [`flier`] — the aircraft: trivial movement, above all the trouble.
//! - [`fleet`] — the air coordinator: sweeps, pings, the ferry loop, the base.
//! - [`stockpile`] — what came back, keyed by block name.

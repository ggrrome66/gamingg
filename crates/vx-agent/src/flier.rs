//! The flying drone: the half of the supply chain that is above all the
//! trouble.
//!
//! # Movement is trivial by design
//!
//! The ground drone's whole existence is shaped by what it cannot climb; the
//! flier's is shaped by not caring. It flies at a clearance above the surface
//! of whatever column it is over, steps one block horizontally per tick, and
//! climbs or descends as the ground underneath demands. No flow fields, no
//! reachability — not needing them *is the fantasy of the flier*, and it is
//! also what makes it nearly free to simulate.
//!
//! # The one rule that is not negotiable
//!
//! The flier is never inside terrain. It only advances into a column once it
//! is already above that column's safe altitude, climbing first if it must.
//! A cliff therefore costs climb time instead of a collision, which is both
//! the honest physics and the visible behaviour: the aircraft rears up over a
//! ridge instead of clipping through it.

//! The job board: what needs doing, and who has claimed it.
//!
//! # Why a board rather than plans
//!
//! Every drone deciding for itself what to do next means every drone paying for
//! that decision, which is what makes swarms expensive. Instead there is one
//! shared list of work and drones take from it. Adding a hundred drones adds a
//! hundred claims, not a hundred planners.
//!
//! # Claiming and completing are separate on purpose
//!
//! It would be tempting to retire a job the moment its region contains no
//! blocks. That works for digging and nothing else. A job that is *held* — a
//! well producing over time, a machine being tended — never empties anything,
//! and inferring completion from the world would have no answer for it. Making
//! completion an explicit act keeps that door open at no cost today.

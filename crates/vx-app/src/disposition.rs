//! Friendship, kept the way this game keeps everything: as a ledger.
//!
//! # Entries, not numbers
//!
//! What was given and what was said is remembered; the *number* is derived
//! from the entries. That is the same shape as the loot ledger and the bounty
//! sheet, and it buys the same things: caps that cannot be gamed by ordering
//! (a third gift this week scores zero because the week's entries are right
//! there to count), birthdays that triple honestly, and a save format that is
//! a list of facts rather than a running total that could drift from them.
//!
//! # What friendship is for
//!
//! Every tier opens something that already exists — nothing here invented a
//! feature to be the reward. Acquainted deepens what people say. Trusted
//! buys intel: a bearing to a bunker, the stage 19 loot loop fed by talk.
//! Close hands you a key — an actual grant through the permits system, to
//! that person's own door, through the rungs and not around them.
//!
//! # Two numbers, one ledger
//!
//! The civic round adds **trust**, which is not friendship. Friendship is
//! what you buy with gifts and conversation; trust is what you buy with
//! business, and the note is specific that it is business that opens a door
//! — "trust through trade is the per-resident stat that unlocks guest
//! authorization on their building".
//!
//! They live on the same ledger rather than in a second file, because a
//! second file would be this one again: the same sparse map, the same
//! [`PersonKey`], the same save. A `Trade` entry counts toward both, and
//! [`Disposition::trust`] reads only the trade entries — so a stranger you
//! have made rich can be let through the door without ever having been
//! liked, and somebody's oldest friend is not automatically their supplier.

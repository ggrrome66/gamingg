//! The controller: a pad driving the seams the keyboard and mouse built.
//!
//! # Synthesis, not a second input system
//!
//! Buttons resolve to the [`KeyCode`] the same action is already bound to
//! and go through the very same `handle_press` / `InputState` path the
//! keyboard uses; the left stick feeds the movement axes, the right stick
//! feeds the mouse-look accumulator, and the triggers mirror the mouse
//! buttons. Nothing downstream knows a pad exists — which is why every
//! panel, the map, the shop and the handheld gained pad support the moment
//! this module compiled, and why there is exactly one implementation of
//! every rule input can reach.
//!
//! # Context is one bit
//!
//! A pad has fewer buttons than a keyboard has keys, so the face buttons
//! mean different things with a panel open — the console convention: south
//! confirms, east backs out. The keyboard already routes keys by which
//! panel is open, so the mapping only needs the one bit; everything finer
//! is downstream's business.
//!
//! # The pad is optional everywhere
//!
//! [`Pad::new`] failing (no udev, a headless test runner, a locked-down
//! container) leaves a `Pad` that polls nothing, forever. Input must never
//! be the reason the game cannot start.

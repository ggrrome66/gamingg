//! The radio network: what the mast at the centre of a town is *for*.
//!
//! # Postings are derived, not stored
//!
//! A town's board is a pure function of that town's seed and its neighbours,
//! exactly as the town itself is a pure function of the world seed and a
//! lattice cell. Walk away and come back and the board reads the same; two
//! players on the same seed see the same work. Nothing about a board is
//! written to disk, and asking a town three kilometres away what it is
//! offering costs a handful of hashes and **loads no chunks** — which is what
//! makes a posting for a town that has never been generated possible at all.
//!
//! # The ledger is the only state
//!
//! What *is* saved is the player's side of it: which postings they took, which
//! they settled, and which towns they have actually stood in. That is player
//! knowledge rather than world truth, so it lives in its own tolerant file
//! beside the map and the wallet — a damaged ledger costs you your contracts,
//! never your world.

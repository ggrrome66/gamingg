//! The welcome panel: hello, here is your house, and here is the whole story.
//!
//! # The changelog cannot rot
//!
//! The panel's changelog is parsed out of `ROADMAP.md` at compile time —
//! `include_str!`, not a hand-maintained copy. The roadmap is already the one
//! honest record of what shipped and what is next; duplicating it into a
//! second list would guarantee the two drift, and a welcome screen that lies
//! about the game is worse than none. A test pins that the parse yields real
//! lines and that every character of them is drawable.
//!
//! # Shown once
//!
//! A zero-byte marker file in the *config* directory — player metadata, not
//! world state, so it does not belong in any world's save and needs no format
//! to version. Presence is the whole protocol.

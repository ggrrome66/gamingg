//! The garage: the machines you actually own.
//!
//! # Why this exists at all
//!
//! Until now machines were free. A flier arrived the moment the world opened
//! and a whole crew of ground drones appeared, unpaid for, on every dispatch —
//! while the shop sold two capped upgrade lines and nothing else. So there was
//! nothing to mine *for*, nothing to trade *for*, and the economy had no sink
//! to drain into.
//!
//! This is the sink. Ore becomes credits, credits become machines, machines
//! mine more ore. That is the loop, and everything else in the game hangs off
//! whether it exists.
//!
//! # Its own file
//!
//! `garage.dat` rather than a field on `wallet.dat`, following the rule
//! [`crate::clock`] states outright: one concern per file, no migrations.
//! Folding it in would force a version bump on a loader that rejects unknown
//! versions outright, and would silently wipe a player's credits the first time
//! they ran a new build against an old save.
//!
//! Machines are **name-keyed**, like skills and upgrade lines, so the shelf
//! grows by adding a row rather than a variant.

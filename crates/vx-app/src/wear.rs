//! Wear: what work costs the machines that do it.
//!
//! # Wear is oracle state, and that decides where it lives
//!
//! Every other "player kit" number in this game — credits, upgrade marks,
//! optics, disposition — is live-only, kept outside the replay hash on
//! purpose. Wear cannot be. A worn crew digs slower, a seized one stops, and
//! how long a crew dug is exactly what decides where the hole ends up. So
//! this ledger sits inside [`crate::mining::Mining`] beside the fuel tank,
//! which is the struct `Rebuilt` carries: replay re-runs the same ticks and
//! re-derives the same wear, and the two sides cannot disagree about how
//! much ground got cut.
//!
//! That is the same argument the fuel loop made, and it is why the two read
//! alike here: **a seized tick is a tick nobody works**, exactly as a dry
//! tick is.
//!
//! # Ticks worked, not seconds elapsed
//!
//! Wear accrues per *tick of work*, never per second of wall time. A machine
//! parked in the garage ages not at all, a machine that dug all night is
//! ruined, and a session recorded on a slow machine wears identically on a
//! fast one — the same reason the journal counts ticks in the first place.
//!
//! # The worst machine sets the pace
//!
//! A crew works as a crew. The duty cycle comes off the *worst* condition in
//! it rather than an average, because an average is something a player has
//! to be told and a worst is something they can see: the roster names the
//! bad machine, and mending that one machine visibly speeds the whole dig.

//! What the fleet burns, and what happens when it runs out.
//!
//! # Machines stop being perpetual
//!
//! Until this round a drone dug forever for nothing. That made every other
//! cost in the game a one-off: buy the machine, and it works free until the
//! sun burns out. A fuel is the first *running* cost, and a running cost is
//! what turns a stockpile into a supply line — the difference between "can I
//! afford this" and "can I keep this going".
//!
//! # Oxyhydrogen
//!
//! The fuel is water taken apart and handed back: two parts hydrogen to one
//! of oxygen, split by electrodes at [`crate::electrolysis`] and burned back
//! into water in the machines. Which means the loop closes on something the
//! world already has an ocean of — the cost was never the water, it is the
//! electrodes, the time, and being somewhere with a lake.
//!
//! # Why the tank lives with the fleet and burns inside `advance`
//!
//! Fuel decides how much ground gets dug, and ground is what the world hash
//! covers — so a tank that behaved differently on replay would be a
//! divergence with the fleet's name on it. The tank therefore lives on
//! `Mining`, which replay carries, and it is drawn and burned inside
//! `Mining::advance`, which is the very call `Command::Advance` replays. No
//! new order is needed for fuelling: both sides run the same code over the
//! same pile for the same number of ticks, and arrive at the same tank.

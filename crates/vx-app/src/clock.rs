//! Time of day, and the light that comes with it.
//!
//! One mapping from a fraction of a day to a sun direction, a sky colour and a
//! light level — pure, total, and the only place the palette lives. The
//! renderer never reads a clock; it is *pushed* a [`vx_render::SunUniform`],
//! which is what keeps headless captures reproducible and the pixel-equality
//! tests honest.
//!
//! Time is persisted in its own small file, following the same rule as the
//! skill sheet, the wallet and the map: one concern per file, no migrations.
//! Folding the hour into `wallet.dat` would force a version bump on a loader
//! that rejects unknown versions outright, and would silently wipe a player's
//! credits the first time they ran a new build against an old save.

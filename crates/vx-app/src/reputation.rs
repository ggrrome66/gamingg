//! Factions: what whole peoples think of you, and what that changes.
//!
//! # Reputation is the memory the bounty board does not have
//!
//! Bounty is a *bill*: it accrues per crime, a warrant answers it, an
//! arrest settles it, and the ledger starts clean. Reputation is what
//! everybody remembers anyway. Settle every fine you like — a county that
//! has watched you breach four vaults trades with you accordingly, and a
//! shelter whose neighbours you dragged to the board does not care that
//! your paperwork is in order. The two stay linked but distinct, exactly
//! as disposition and law have been since the townsfolk round: bounty is
//! per-incident and settleable, standing is cumulative and lived-with.
//!
//! # Two factions, because two exist
//!
//! **The Compact** is the settled towns — one people already in every
//! mechanical sense: one lattice, one beacon network, one economy hauling
//! between them, one warrant that follows you town to town. **The
//! Holdouts** are whoever holds the shelters — the squads stage 29 raised
//! from each bunker's seed. Nothing else in this world has a flag to fly,
//! and a faction system with more factions than peoples would be a menu,
//! not a world. The military tier, when it arrives, gets its own name;
//! this file grows by adding a field, which is the same promise every
//! name-keyed ledger in this game makes.
//!
//! # Live-only, like every opinion of the player
//!
//! Standing reaches no block and no hash. It is disposition at faction
//! scale, kept in its own small file, and the replay oracle never learns
//! anyone had a reputation at all.

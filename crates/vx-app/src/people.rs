//! Who the townsfolk are: identity, temperament, and what they say.
//!
//! # One personality, both lives
//!
//! The design note's core bet: **a person is one agent with two policies**,
//! and the part both policies share is temperament. The archetype that makes
//! a shopkeeper chatty at the counter is the archetype that will make her
//! slow to panic when the hostiles round arrives; the trait that makes a
//! drifter craven in conversation is the trait that will make him surrender
//! early in a bunker. Character is one derivation, spent twice — and an
//! "unpredictable" person stays deterministic, because the variation is
//! rolled at *creation* and never at runtime.
//!
//! This round spends the civic half. `nerve` sits unread until the combat
//! rounds — deliberately derived *now*, so the day composure lands, every
//! person already has the number and no save changes meaning.
//!
//! # Derived, except where authored
//!
//! The hometown trio — the Mayor, the Sheriff, Old Prat — are authored, with
//! authored gift tables, because the town every player starts in should have
//! people somebody wrote. Everyone else in the world is arithmetic on the
//! site hash, exactly like the town they live in.
//!
//! # Gossip is telemetry wearing a coat
//!
//! Dialogue pools are keyed `(archetype × context)`, and the lines are
//! templates over the *live simulation* — the books' prices, the bounty
//! ledger, the fleet's tank. This is what a derived villager can have that an
//! authored one cannot: things to say that are true.

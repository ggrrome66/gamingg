//! The command journal: what the player told the world to do, in order.
//!
//! # Why a log and not a picture
//!
//! Ask who actually edits this world. The player breaks a few hundred blocks by
//! hand over a session. A single drone excavating an open pit moves *tens of
//! thousands* — and it moves exactly the same ones every time, because
//! `digging_is_deterministic` says so and the chunk-pinning in
//! [`vx_agent::working_span`] is what makes that true regardless of where the
//! player was standing.
//!
//! So writing the drone's output to disk is writing down the output of a
//! deterministic function whose input was one line. A whole mine — every bench,
//! every haul, every block — is recoverable from `Dispatch { area, method }`
//! plus the number of ticks it was allowed to run.
//!
//! That is what this records. Region files still hold the ground (they are the
//! keyframes); the log holds everything since the last one, and replaying it
//! reconstructs the rest.
//!
//! # Ticks, never seconds
//!
//! [`crate::mining::Mining::update`] turns wall-clock elapsed time into a tick
//! count, and that conversion depends on frame rate, stalls, and how long
//! somebody dragged the window. None of it is reproducible. The tick count is.
//! So the log records `Advance { ticks }` and replays through
//! [`crate::mining::Mining::advance`], which means a session recorded at nine
//! frames a second replays identically at three hundred.
//!
//! # What it is worth beyond small saves
//!
//! A log plus a content hash is a *determinism oracle*. Replay it and check the
//! world came out the same, and you have a test that covers worldgen, agents
//! and editing all at once — one that catches divergence no unit test is shaped
//! to find. A save becomes a perfect reproduction case. Rewind becomes possible.
//! None of that is built here; all of it is opened up by recording orders
//! instead of outcomes.

// Bumped to 2 when a dispatch gained its crew size and to 3 when the player's
// own movement joined the log — both format changes.
//
// Four and five are *world* changes: the player's house joined the hometown,
// then the lockboxes and the security office did. An older log replays against
// ground that no longer generates, so it would report a divergence that is
// nobody's fault. Refusing it lets the oracle restart honestly instead. A
// journal is an oracle rather than a load path — region files are still written
// every save — so an old one being rejected costs a determinism check, not a
// world.
//
// Six added the gold panel's admin orders. A cheat is an order like any other:
// the moment an admin action mutated state outside this log, the oracle would
// be blind to it and every replay of that session would report a divergence
// that is nobody's fault.
//
// Seven added `Fire`. Shots break blocks, so a firefight is part of the hash.
//
// Eight is both kinds at once: the roost box joined the security office roof
// (a world change, like four and five) and the kestrel's standing orders
// joined the log (a format change). The scout itself never touches ground —
// its orders replay as documented no-ops — but the log stays the complete
// record of what was ordered.
//
// Nine is both kinds again: the watch box became its own block (a world
// change) and intrusion orders joined the log (a format change). An
// intrusion moves claims and grants, never ground, so it replays as a
// no-op like the scout's orders.
//
// Ten is both again: the fabricator became a block, and `Print` joined the
// log. Unlike the scout and the coil, a print is *not* a no-op — it eats
// the base pile, and the pile is something `Rebuilt` carries. So replay
// spends the materials exactly as the live game did, and only the outputs
// that live outside the pile are the honest no-ops.
//
// Eleven is a world change alone: caves. The carve is part of generated
// ground, so every hash a version-ten journal recorded was taken over
// terrain that no longer exists. No format change — the same commands read
// the same way — but pretending the old hashes still bind would make every
// old session replay as a divergence that is really this bump.
//
// Twelve is the promised "recipe indices are content" bump: the optics rows
// joined the fabricator's catalogue in ladder order rather than at the end,
// which renumbers every recipe after them — and `Print` records a recipe by
// index. A version-eleven journal's Print entries would replay as different
// recipes spending different materials, which is exactly the divergence this
// number exists to name.
//
// Thirteen is a world change alone, like eleven: bunkers. The ground now
// holds works that were not there, so every hash a version-twelve journal
// recorded was taken over terrain that no longer exists.
//
// Sixteen founds every building and every fort wall on footings, which is
// generated ground that was not there before.
//
// Fifteen adds `Bank` — goods across a strongroom counter — and the star
// forts and bank buildings that generated ground now carries. Both kinds of
// change at once, like eight and nine before it.
//
// Fourteen adds `Electrolyse` — a format change, and one that reaches the
// hash by a longer road than usual. The order itself only moves goods, but
// the fleet burns those goods to dig, so a log replayed without it would
// run the crew dry at a different tick and leave a different hole.
//
// Seventeen adds `Talk` and `Gift` — the townsfolk got names. Talk replays
// as a no-op like `Scout`; `Gift` takes a good off the base pile, which is
// state `Rebuilt` carries, so the format change is also a meaning change.
//
// Eighteen changes no command at all — it renumbers them. Five upgrade
// parts joined the fabricator's catalogue *in ladder order*, which shifts
// the indices `Print` records, so a version-seventeen log replayed here
// would print the wrong pattern and spend the wrong materials. The same
// reason twelve exists: recipe indices are content, and the ladder is worth
// more than an append-only table.
//
// Nineteen adds `Repair`. Wear is the first machine state that had to live
// *inside* the replayed `Mining` rather than beside it in a live-only file,
// because how long a crew turned is what decides where the hole ends up —
// so mending a machine is an order the log must carry, and its replay arm
// spends the same parts off the same pile.
// Twenty is two changes at once, like eight and fifteen before it. The
// ground changed: uranium joined the ore lattice below the overburden, and
// oil and gas bodies are stamped into the deep stone off a lattice of their
// own — a log recorded over the old rock would replay its digging into rock
// that is no longer the same rock. And `Spud` joins the commands, because a
// well eats casing off the pile and puts barrels back on it, which is the
// `Electrolyse` argument word for word: the fleet burns what the pile holds,
// so a replay that skipped a well would run the crew dry at a different tick
// and leave a different hole.
// Twenty-one moves generated ground twice over. Every town on the frontier
// now walls itself: what used to come back `Open` — a hamlet with nothing
// around it — is a mini star, four short bastions on a low thin trace drawn
// in tight against the buildings. And every town gained a clinic, which is a
// building where there was open plot. A log recorded over the old ground
// would replay its digging into rock that has a wall through it.
// Twenty-two changes what grows on the ground rather than what is under it.
// Every column now belongs to one of three forests, decided by how high and
// how wet it is: peat bog in the flat convergent lows, mixed hardwood with
// the odd emergent giant through the middle, subalpine conifer up high
// thinning to knee-high krummholz at the treeline and bare rock above it.
// The trees themselves changed species, shape and density, the bog carpets
// itself in sphagnum instead of grass, and nothing at all stands above the
// tree limit. A log recorded over the old forest would replay a crew driving
// through trunks that are no longer there and around ones that are.
// Twenty-three adds `Fell`. A tree coming down is the largest single edit
// the player can make to the ground: the stem leaves, the crown leaves,
// whatever the arc swept through leaves, a neighbour may come down with it,
// and a line of logs is written along where it landed. All of that is
// re-derived from the cut — the stump and the face — by the same kinematic
// arc, so the order stays an order. A log recorded before this replays a
// forest that never fell.
// Twenty-four sets the water moving. A block of it now carries a fill level
// in the same sixty-four cells a wounded block carries its damage in, and a
// hole cut beside water wakes an automaton that pours, levels and settles
// over the ticks that follow. Water that moves is ground that moves, so a log
// recorded before this replays a lake that never went anywhere.
// Twenty-five hands the world a sky and lets it burn. Weather is a pure
// function of the seed, the tick and the region, so no order records it —
// but it now edits the ground twice over. Lightning, hashed off the same
// tick, lights the tall and the lonely; the fire eats uphill and downwind
// and leaves ash and snags behind it; and the stands it cleared — along with
// every stand a saw cleared — come back through meadow, thicket and mixed
// forest on the day clock. A log recorded before this replays a country with
// no weather, no fire and no regrowth, over ground that all three moved.

//! Town markets: what each place makes, wants, holds and charges.
//!
//! # The first thing here that is not a pure function of the seed
//!
//! Everything else in this world can be recomputed: terrain, ore, trees, town
//! sites, the work a beacon posts. A market cannot, because the player changes
//! it — sell forty loads of ore and the price moves, and it has to still be
//! moved tomorrow. So this is the first state that genuinely has to be *kept*.
//!
//! It is kept as cheaply as the rest: a town's opening books are derived from
//! its site, so the save holds an entry only for a town something has actually
//! touched. A frontier of a thousand untouched towns costs nothing.
//!
//! # Fast-forward on read
//!
//! Nothing ticks. A market carries the tick it was last brought up to date, and
//! reading it integrates production and consumption forward to now. A town three
//! kilometres away costs nothing until something asks about it, and then costs
//! one short loop.
//!
//! ## Why the loop is quantised rather than closed-form
//!
//! The obvious implementation is `stock += rate * elapsed`, in one multiply. It
//! is wrong, and wrong in a way that would have been very hard to see later.
//!
//! Flows here are *clamped* — a mine's ore fills up and stops, a refinery stops
//! when it runs out of ore to melt. Once a clamp binds, one big step and many
//! small steps stop agreeing: in one big step the mine saturates and the
//! refinery then eats a full day's worth all at once, while in small steps the
//! refinery keeps making room for the mine to refill into. The books would then
//! depend on *when the player happened to look*, which is exactly the class of
//! bug stage 9a spent its whole round removing from the drones.
//!
//! So catch-up runs in fixed [`STEP`]-tick chunks, always landing on a step
//! boundary. Integrating to tick 5 000 and then to 10 000 gives bit-for-bit
//! what integrating straight to 10 000 gives, clamps or no clamps — and there
//! is a test that says so. A whole in-game day of neglect is forty steps.

//! Towns somebody founded.
//!
//! # The third route into office, and the gap it had to cross
//!
//! The civic note named three ways to hold a town's chair: win it at the
//! ballot box, **found a town and hold its offices by default**, or take one.
//! Stage 40 shipped the first. This module is the second.
//!
//! Every civic system — the roster, the offices, the market, the ballot, the
//! permits, the schedule, the wall — takes a [`TownSite`] and keys on its
//! centre or its seed. A town that is not on the lattice slots into all of
//! them unchanged. The one thing that could not see such a town was worldgen,
//! which is pure in `(seed, cell)` and must stay so. The project's idiom for
//! that is the one every round since 36 has used: **a stored ledger whose
//! effect on the ground is a journaled edit**. Stands, wells, the fluid and
//! fire are all that shape, and so is a charter.
//!
//! # Derived, not authored
//!
//! A charter stores a [`TownSite`] and the tick it was filed. The site is
//! built by [`site_at`] exactly the way the lattice builds its own — ground
//! from the natural height clamped the same way, the hometown's core width,
//! a seed hashed off the world's and the centre — so everything downstream
//! falls out of that seed: three settlers and their trades, the market's
//! opening books, the fort's trace. A founded town is named from the same
//! book every other town is named from, and nothing past this module can
//! tell which kind of town it is looking at. That is the point.
//!
//! # What is stored
//!
//! Only what cannot be derived: the sites founded, when, and how many
//! charters have been printed and not yet filed. The ground itself is the
//! journal's business — `Command::Found` raises it on both sides of the
//! oracle — and this ledger is the bookkeeping that lives beside it.

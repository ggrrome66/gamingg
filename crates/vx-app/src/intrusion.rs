//! Hacking through machines: the Security line's work, done at arm's length.
//!
//! # Not a minigame
//!
//! Stage 11 set the rule that locks are gated by hard floors, not dice —
//! below the Security floor you cannot start, above it the work takes the
//! time it takes. Moving that work onto a drone changes *who is exposed and
//! where the operator stands*. It does not change the odds, because there
//! are no odds, and that is what keeps an intrusion journallable, replayable
//! and honest on a machine with no mouse to wiggle.
//!
//! # The machine is exposed; the owner is billed
//!
//! Remote intrusion's whole appeal is that you are not standing at the lock,
//! so the witness rule has to say plainly what happens when the drone is
//! seen instead: a witnessed machine marks its owner, exactly as a witnessed
//! hand would. What the coil buys is distance from the *scene*, never from
//! the *consequence*. And an autonomous machine caught at a lock is grabbed
//! — impounded, with a fine at the counter — while one you are personally
//! flying can still be flown away, which is the honest difference between
//! leaving a tool somewhere and holding it.
//!
//! # The tool is a module, the ceiling is the skill
//!
//! A coil says *where* the work can happen: the kestrel's small frame takes
//! the light one, heavier frames take the heavy one. What the work may
//! attempt is capped by the operator's Security level — the same floors
//! stage 11 already enforces. Neither substitutes for the other, so the shop
//! cannot sell what practice has not earned.

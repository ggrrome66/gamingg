//! Banks: the one building in town whose business is holding your things.
//!
//! # Two problems, one strongroom
//!
//! A trade run starts with goods in the wrong place. Until now the only store
//! this game had was the fleet's base pile, which lives wherever you put the
//! container — so hauling to a market meant carrying everything and selling in
//! one lump, and staging a load *near* a town was not a thing you could do.
//! A vault fixes both halves: leave goods in the town you mean to sell them in
//! and come back when the price is right, or park what you cannot afford to
//! lose somewhere with a door on it.
//!
//! # Per town, and derived from nothing
//!
//! Each town keeps its own books, keyed by the town's centre — the same key
//! the economy uses, so a vault and a market always agree about which town
//! they belong to. Unlike almost everything else here the contents are *not*
//! derived: they are exactly what somebody put there, which is the whole
//! point of a bank.
//!
//! # The heaviest lock in the game finally has something behind it
//!
//! Stage 11 built three grades of lockbox and the third has never been
//! stamped anywhere: "endgame; nothing stamps one yet". The bank carries it.
//! Getting in illegitimately is possible, slow, loud and expensive — which is
//! the shape that round was designed around, and it took a building worth
//! robbing to give it a subject.

//! The roost: the town's own kestrel, in a box on the security office roof.
//!
//! # One machine, two owners
//!
//! The sheriff's watcher is the same airframe the player can buy, with the
//! same movement, the same senses and the same battery problem. The player
//! learns exactly what the law can see by owning the thing that sees it, and
//! every counter to being watched is honest mechanics: break sky line of
//! sight until the mark decays, bait it aloft and outlast its endurance —
//! while it recharges in the box the town is blind, which is the heist
//! window — or destroy it, which is property, and priced accordingly.
//!
//! # It hears; it does not aim
//!
//! The box wakes on loud *report* events — a lock breached, a shot fired in
//! town — flies to where the noise came from, and watches. A first sighting
//! gets you *observed*: the drone overhead, visibly, is the warning.
//! Offences committed while observed are witnessed, feeding the bounty
//! ledger stage 11 built. The roost never attacks; the escalation it
//! carries is the ladder that already exists, with an eye that does not
//! blink first.
//!
//! Like the kestrel's marks, all of this is live-side: the roost never
//! touches ground, so the replay oracle never needs to hear about it.

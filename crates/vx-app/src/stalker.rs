//! The thing in the deep, and the director that never tells it the truth.
//!
//! # Two brains, on purpose
//!
//! The hunt note's design, landed whole. A **director** knows exactly where
//! the player is and is forbidden from saying so: everything it passes to
//! the creature is quantised to a [`crate::garrison::HINT_GRADE`] zone — the
//! same thirty-two-metre cell the shelters' director uses, because there is
//! one rule about lying to your own monsters and it should be written once.
//! A **creature** takes that cell and closes the rest of the distance with
//! the same occupancy search a posse uses, which is what makes it genuinely
//! huntable and genuinely evadable. It cannot walk to you, because it does
//! not know where you are.
//!
//! # It hunts by ear, and machines are loud
//!
//! What attaches this to *this* game rather than to a haunted corridor: the
//! director's hints are weighted by noise, and the noisiest thing in the
//! world is a working mine. A drill chewing rock, a crew turning, a shot —
//! every report the town's roost can hear, the deep thing hears better. So
//! the tension lands on the core loop rather than beside it. Run the swarm
//! loud and rich, run it quiet and slow, or dig a decoy a valley over and
//! work in the noise of your own diversion.
//!
//! # Pacing, and the floor it never spawns inside
//!
//! Pressure is the director's other job. Sustained contact spends a budget;
//! when it runs out the creature is *made* to break off for
//! [`BACK_OFF`] seconds, which is what turns a monster into a rhythm. And
//! nothing ever appears within [`NO_SPAWN_R`] of the player: it arrives from
//! somewhere, always, because a thing that materialises in your face is a
//! jump scare and this is supposed to be a hunt.
//!
//! # Live-only
//!
//! Like the posse and the garrisons, none of this is journalled. It reads
//! the world, spends the player's health and says things; it never writes a
//! block, never touches the pile, and never decides how long the fleet
//! turns. The oracle has no business here.

//! What uranium costs to be near.
//!
//! # The bargain the deep ore makes
//!
//! Uranium is the richest thing in the ground by a long way, and if that
//! were the whole story it would simply be the ore you mine once you can
//! reach it — a better copper. What makes it a *decision* is that the face
//! you are cutting is doing something to you while you cut it. Nothing here
//! is a timer or a debuff icon: exposure is a function of how much bare
//! uranium is within a few blocks of your body, which means every lever a
//! player has over it is a physical one. Cut and back off. Wall the face
//! back up. Send a drone instead of standing there. Put lead in the suit.
//!
//! # Live-only, on purpose
//!
//! Dose spends health, and health has been live-only state since stage 28:
//! nothing here touches the world, the pile, or how long the fleet turns, so
//! the oracle never needs to hear about it. Two sessions with identical
//! journals can end with different dose and the same world hash, which is
//! exactly the line this game draws between what the log carries and what it
//! does not.
//!
//! # Why it counts blocks rather than tracing rays
//!
//! A proper attenuation model would trace to each source and charge for the
//! rock in between. It would also be a lie dressed as physics: what a player
//! can perceive is "how much of this stuff is near me", and a sum over a
//! small box says that honestly for a fraction of the cost. The one piece of
//! shielding that *is* modelled is the one a player controls — the lead in
//! the suit.

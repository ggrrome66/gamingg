//! The minimap: where you have been, and where everything is right now.
//!
//! # The explored set is the only state
//!
//! Worldgen is a pure function of `(seed, position)`, so the surface of an
//! explored-but-unloaded chunk can be recomputed from the generator's height
//! field on demand. The map therefore stores no terrain thumbnails at all —
//! just the set of chunks you (or the flier) have seen. Accepted consequence:
//! edits and mine holes show only while their chunks are loaded; distant
//! explored land draws as generated.
//!
//! # Player knowledge, not world truth
//!
//! The explored set persists in its own small file beside the region files
//! rather than inside them, because it belongs to the player rather than the
//! world. Losing it is cosmetic, so a damaged file logs and starts empty —
//! it must never take the world down with it.

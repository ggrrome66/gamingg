//! The wellhead: the first machine whose whole job is patience.
//!
//! # A different kind of machine
//!
//! Every machine before this one is somewhere you *are*. A drone digs where
//! you sent it, the fabricator prints while you watch the bar, the
//! electrolyser wants you standing on a shore. A well is somewhere you were:
//! you carry the head out to a place the ground says something is under,
//! spend the casing, wait out the drilling, and then leave it lifting barrels
//! into your pile while you go and do something else. It is the first thing
//! in this game that *keeps paying* — and, because a reservoir is finite, the
//! first thing that stops.
//!
//! # Why this lives inside the replayed simulation
//!
//! A well puts goods on the base pile, and the pile is what the fleet burns,
//! what the shop sells and what the fabricator eats. Wear taught this lesson
//! in stage 26 and the tank taught it in 20: anything whose arithmetic
//! decides how much ground gets dug has to live inside the call
//! `Command::Advance` re-runs, or a replayed session and its own journal
//! disagree about the world. So [`Wells`] hangs off `Mining`, ticks inside
//! `Mining::advance`, and every number here is a constant rather than a
//! setting.
//!
//! What is *not* in the oracle: the panel, the cursor and the feedback line.
//! Those are live-only, exactly like the electrolyser's, because refusing to
//! spud a hole changes nothing about the world.
//!
//! # The bet
//!
//! [`vx_world::reservoir::reservoir_under`] is pure in the seed, so a dry
//! hole is a *place* rather than a dice roll: the same column is dry in every
//! session of that world, and a player who learns the ground learns something
//! true. The panel says whether the mud log shows a trace before you commit,
//! and nothing else — what fluid, how much, and how deep are all things you
//! find out by drilling, which is what makes drilling worth doing.

//! Who may edit what, who is watching, and what it costs when they are.
//!
//! # The ladder
//!
//! Three ways past a locked door, priced so the honest one is the best one:
//!
//! 1. **Authenticate.** Free, permanent, no risk. Trust earned through trade
//!    (stage 12) is what unlocks it; this round only the owner qualifies.
//! 2. **Hack.** Fast, needs the [`crate::skills::SECURITY`] line, and leaves
//!    the lock standing so nobody need ever know — if nobody sees you.
//! 3. **Break the lock.** Slow, needs a serious drill, throws the whole
//!    building open until the town puts a new box up, and is the loudest thing
//!    you can do.
//!
//! Every number in this file exists to keep that order true.
//!
//! # Claims are derived, never stored
//!
//! A town's buildings are a pure function of its site (`vx_world::town::plan`),
//! so a claim is too. What is *stored* is only what cannot be derived: who has
//! been let in, who holds office, what the player has been caught doing, and
//! how far through a lock they have drilled.
//!
//! # Why the gate lives on the event bus
//!
//! `break_block` and `place_block` have emitted cancellable events since stage
//! 2.x with nothing listening. Subscribing here means every caller is covered —
//! the player's drill, a drone's cutter, anything added later — without one
//! call site changing. Replay is exempt for free: it is handed a fresh
//! `EventBus`, so the oracle never sees the gate.

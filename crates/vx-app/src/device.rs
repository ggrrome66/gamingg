//! The handheld: the fleet in your pocket.
//!
//! Two jobs, deliberately separable. *Viewing* puts the camera behind a
//! machine's eyes while it carries on working — you are a passenger. *Control*
//! is the master override: the machine drops what it was doing and answers to
//! the sticks. Keeping them apart means you can watch a drone work without
//! hijacking it, which is most of what you actually want to do.
//!
//! The panel itself is pixels, exactly like the shop and the HUD: a plain RGBA
//! buffer stamped with the bitmap font and shipped through an overlay slot.
//! The compositor knows nothing about what any of it means.

//! Putting a tree on the ground.
//!
//! The numbers here are forestry rather than invention. Directional felling
//! cuts a **face notch** into the side the tree is meant to fall toward —
//! traditionally about a third of the trunk's diameter, less in modern
//! practice — and leaves a **hinge** of roughly a tenth of the diameter on
//! the far side. The notch aims the tree; the hinge steers it down. When the
//! cut takes the holding wood below the hinge the stem can no longer carry
//! its own lean and over it goes. Cut a hard leaner too fast and the trunk
//! splits upward instead — a **barber chair** — and it goes where it is heavy
//! rather than where it was aimed.
//!
//! All of that lands on machinery this engine already has. A trunk block's
//! cross-section *is* [`vx_world::micro`]'s sixty-four-cell mask, so "a third
//! of the way through" is a popcount, and [`micro::Shape::Notch`] is the cut.
//!
//! **The fall is kinematic, and that is a determinism decision, not a
//! shortcut.** Float rigid-body integration diverges across runs and machines;
//! the replay oracle would not survive it. A trunk rotating about its hinge
//! under the honest pendulum equation is a pure function of the tree, the
//! direction and the tick — cheap, replayable, and still collidable every
//! tick against everything in its way. The module is shaped exactly like
//! [`crate::arsenal`]: the world edits happen *inside* [`advance_falls`], and
//! the sweeps it returns carry the live-only half — who got hit, how loud it
//! was — for the caller to spend or drop.

//! The village's inhabitants: deterministic wanderers with a word for you.
//!
//! No RNG state anywhere — waypoints and pauses come from hashing the
//! villager's index and how many legs of their stroll they have walked, so
//! two runs fed the same frame times are bit-identical, and nothing needs
//! saving. Each villager owns a rectangle of the village authored to contain
//! no buildings, walks its plateau at a stroll, and pauses like somebody with
//! somewhere to be eventually.
//!
//! Greetings use hysteresis: a line fires when the player comes within
//! [`GREET_RANGE`] and cannot fire again until they have stepped back out
//! past [`REARM_RANGE`] — once per approach, not once per frame.

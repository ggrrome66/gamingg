//! The ballot box: how a seat changes hands.
//!
//! # A seat nobody could ever lose
//!
//! Stage 39 put a mayor and a sheriff in every town, derived off the town's
//! own seed — which was the right way to have them and the wrong way to keep
//! them. [`crate::office::holder`] is a pure function, so the mayor of a town
//! was its mayor forever, and a warrant chain whose decider can never be
//! replaced has one fixed link in it.
//!
//! This module is the overlay that lets the derivation be *wrong*. Everything
//! about an election is arithmetic on the seed and the ledgers except the one
//! fact an election produces — who won — and that is stored the way this
//! project stores everything: **only where it differs**. A frontier nobody has
//! campaigned in has an empty register and every seat still at its derived
//! default, exactly as an unburnt forest has an empty
//! [`crate::succession::Ledger`].
//!
//! # Goodwill is the trade ledger, which already exists
//!
//! The civic note asks for votes cast on "goodwill points, earned through
//! trade interactions — the resident who profits from trading with you votes
//! your way, which reuses the trade ledger rather than inventing a reputation
//! system from nothing." Stage 39 built exactly that ledger:
//! [`crate::disposition::trust`] is what somebody has put across their own
//! counter with you, kept separate from friendship. So a vote reads trust
//! first, friendship second, and nothing here invents a third number.
//!
//! # Polling day is the market day
//!
//! A town already picks a weekday to hold its market
//! ([`crate::schedule::market_weekday`]) and already sends everybody to the
//! square on it. Voting on that day costs no new clock, puts the whole town in
//! one place for it, and stays pure in `(site, day)` — so both sides of the
//! oracle agree on when an election happens without anybody recording it.

//! Credits and bought upgrades: the money half of the player file pair.
//!
//! Same discipline as [`crate::skills`]: upgrades are **name-keyed entries**,
//! not enum variants, so the shop's shelf grows by adding rows, and the file
//! (`wallet.dat`, its own small file beside `player.dat` — one concern per
//! file, no migrations) tolerates absence and damage. A corrupt wallet is an
//! empty wallet, logged, never a failed world.
//!
//! Upgrade *effects* compose multiplicatively on top of skill effects: the
//! grind and the wallet both work for the player, and a fresh wallet (level
//! 0 everywhere) is the exact identity.

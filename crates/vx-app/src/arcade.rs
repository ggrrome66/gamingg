//! The pocket arcade: a small original shooter that runs on the handheld.
//!
//! # It is not a port of anything
//!
//! The licensing note in `ROADMAP.md` has said so since long before this
//! stage existed, and it is the first constraint here rather than an
//! afterthought: no WAD, no borrowed engine, no sprites off a disc. Every
//! wall, every colour and every shape below is computed from numbers, the
//! same way the terrain, the block tiles and the gunfire already are. The
//! *form* — a grid of walls drawn a column at a time, things coming at you
//! down a corridor — is thirty years old and belongs to nobody.
//!
//! # A column at a time, into a buffer somebody is holding
//!
//! The renderer is the classic one, and it is classic because it is the
//! cheapest thing that works: for each of the 240 columns on the handheld's
//! screen, walk the grid until a wall is hit, and draw a vertical strip whose
//! height is the reciprocal of that distance. No triangles, no GPU, no new
//! pipeline. The frame it produces is a plain RGBA buffer exactly like every
//! other panel in this game, which means it lands on the unit's glass through
//! the same projection stage 33 built — the game is *on the thing in your
//! hands*, not in a window over it.
//!
//! # The floors are a number
//!
//! [`Level::of`] carves its map with the world's own hashing, and carves it
//! as a single continuous walk, so the map is connected **by construction**:
//! there is no reachability check anywhere below because there is no way to
//! author an unreachable exit. The same cartridge therefore plays the same
//! floors in the same order on every machine, which is the only thing that
//! makes a high score worth keeping.
//!
//! # Live-only
//!
//! Nothing here touches the world, the pile, the clock or the journal. It is
//! a toy on a screen, and the replay oracle has never heard of it.

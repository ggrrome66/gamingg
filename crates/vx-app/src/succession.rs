//! What grows back, and how long it takes.
//!
//! The forest note assumed this existed. It did not: until stage 36 nothing
//! could disturb a stand, so a ledger would have had nothing to hold. Felling
//! and fire changed that, and this is the other half of the cycle — the part
//! that makes a burn a *disturbance* rather than a scar.
//!
//! **Only disturbed stands are stored.** Untouched forest stays exactly what
//! it has been since stage 35: a pure function of the seed, derived on
//! demand, costing nothing. What is kept is a sparse table of the lattice
//! cells something happened to, keyed the way [`vx_world::flora`] keys its
//! own lattice — the same trick the micro-mask uses to store wounds without
//! storing the blocks that have none.
//!
//! **The four stages are the note's, and so is their ordering.** Meadow,
//! pioneer thicket, mixed, old growth. Real chronosequences run eighty to
//! four hundred years and the note is explicit about what to do with that:
//! compress the absolute durations by one to two orders of magnitude and keep
//! the *sequence* and the *relative* rates honest. So a black-spruce bog comes
//! back fastest — it reseeds itself from an aerial seed bank the fire opened —
//! a hardwood cove takes its time through pioneers to climax, and subalpine
//! conifer is the slowest thing on the map, because at that altitude it is.
//!
//! **Regrowth is an edit, not a generator change.** Worldgen stays pure; the
//! ledger stamps each stage into the world as blocks, exactly as the wells
//! and the fluid do. That keeps chunk generation free of mutable state and
//! keeps this module's whole effect inspectable as ordinary ground.

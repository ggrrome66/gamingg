//! The beacon console: the panel the radio mast puts in front of you.
//!
//! The shop's twin (overlay slot 5), and deliberately so — the same cursor,
//! the same Enter-confirms, the same one-line feedback. What differs is where
//! the rows come from: the shop sells from a table, the board reads work off
//! [`crate::beacon::postings_for`], which is derived from the town rather than
//! stored anywhere.
//!
//! Settlement lives here rather than in [`crate::beacon`] because it is the
//! only place that has the pile, the wallet and the survey record to hand at
//! once; the ledger itself stays a record of what happened, not a rule about
//! what may.

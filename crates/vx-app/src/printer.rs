//! The fabricator: raw stock in, anything out.
//!
//! # Why a printer and not a crafting table
//!
//! A grid of shaped recipes is a memory game about where to put the sticks.
//! This game already has a better vocabulary for the same idea: everything it
//! owns is a **name-keyed row** — blocks, skills, upgrade lines, machines,
//! goods. So the fabricator takes named goods out of a pile and puts named
//! things back, and "it can make anything" means precisely "adding a thing is
//! adding a row". That is a promise the codebase can actually keep.
//!
//! # The pile is the inventory
//!
//! There is no player-carried inventory and this round does not invent one.
//! The printer reads and writes the fleet's base stockpile — the pile the
//! flier ferries into, the pile the shop sells out of, the pile the drill now
//! fills. One pile, three doors, no transfer minigame.
//!
//! # What an upgrade may be made of
//!
//! This round the fabricator learned to print *upgrades* — the same lines
//! the counter sells for credits, bought instead with ore and time. That
//! turned up a rule worth writing on the wall: **the inputs of a recipe are
//! oracle state, the refusal to start it is not.** Replay re-runs
//! `Command::Print` by taking `recipe.inputs` off the pile, so a cost that
//! varied with anything live — a wallet level, the hour, the weather — would
//! have the two sides take different amounts and the pile would drift.
//! [`refuse`] is only ever asked live, so *that* may look at anything it
//! likes. So the parts cost a flat price and the gate stiffens instead: each
//! mark on a line demands more Fabrication than the last.
//!
//! # Materials and time, never credits
//!
//! Buying a drone with credits and printing one out of copper are two
//! different routes to the same machine, and that is the point: the counter
//! is for people with money, the printer is for people with a mine. Nothing
//! here charges credits. Fuel plugs into this later — the fuel loop is a
//! stage away — and when it does, it costs the printer time rather than
//! changing what a recipe means.

//! The player's movement: stance, stamina, ledges, and the weight of what you
//! are carrying.
//!
//! # Why this is a command and not a `dt`
//!
//! Everything else in this world runs on ticks. Mining quantises elapsed time
//! before it touches a block, villagers take the hour as an argument, the
//! economy catches its markets up in fixed steps. The player was the last actor
//! still integrated straight off the frame clock, which meant where you ended
//! up depended on how fast your machine drew — and house rule 2 says agents are
//! bit-identical given the same inputs. The player is an agent.
//!
//! So held keys become a [`MoveCommand`] once per frame and the simulation
//! consumes one per tick at [`MOVE_HZ`]. That is not a new idiom: `PilotCommand`
//! in `vx-agent` already does exactly this for a driven machine, for exactly
//! this reason.
//!
//! # Why 64 Hz and not 60
//!
//! Because the command journal speaks in mining ticks, and mining runs at 8 Hz.
//! Sixty over eight is seven and a half; sixty-four over eight is exactly eight.
//! An integer ratio means `Advance { ticks }` keeps the meaning it already has
//! and replay simply runs eight movement sub-ticks per journal tick. A
//! fractional one would have forced a clock change through the whole log format
//! to buy nothing.
//!
//! # What lives here and what does not
//!
//! The AABB sweep is `vx_world::step_aabb` and knows nothing about any of this.
//! Stance, stamina, ledges and carried mass are fiction, so they live here —
//! the same line that keeps `vx-agent` free of quests and economy.

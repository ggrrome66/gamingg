//! The optics kit: the lamp you carry and the visors you print.
//!
//! # Light is worn, not placed
//!
//! Stage 17 made the world below genuinely dark, and the honest fix for
//! darkness in this game is equipment, not a settings slider. The basic hand
//! lamp is part of the suit — everyone has it, because falling into a pothole
//! with no way to see the walls is a trap, not a mechanic. Everything better
//! is made at the fabricator: a high beam that throws further, a night vision
//! visor that amplifies what little light there is, and a thermal visor that
//! does not care about light at all and paints warm machinery against cold
//! rock. The counter sells none of it; seeing in the dark belongs to people
//! with a mine, which is who needs it.
//!
//! # One key, one dial
//!
//! `L` cycles Off → Lamp → Night vision → Thermal, skipping anything not
//! owned. A mode is a way of *seeing*, so it lives entirely in the renderer:
//! the lamp is a spot cone in the shader, the visors are colour transforms,
//! and none of it touches the world or the journal. What persists is what you
//! own — name-keyed, like every other possession in this game — plus the mode
//! you left the dial on.

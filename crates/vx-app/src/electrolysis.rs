//! The electrolyser: a lake, two electrodes, and patience.
//!
//! # Where fuel comes from
//!
//! Every other good in this game is dug out of the ground or made from
//! something that was. Oxyhydrogen is neither: it is water taken apart, and
//! the world has an ocean of water. That would make it free, so the cost is
//! moved to the three things that are not free — the **electrodes**, which
//! wear away into the bath as copper; the **time**, which is real minutes of
//! a machine running; and the **place**, because an electrolyser has to
//! stand where there is water to split.
//!
//! That last one is the interesting constraint. It is the first machine in
//! this game whose *position* is part of whether it works at all, which
//! turns a lake shore from scenery into somewhere worth building.
//!
//! # Built like the fabricator, on purpose
//!
//! One job at a time, materials charged up front, progress on the journal's
//! clock, a panel with rows and a cursor. Not because a second machine had to
//! be identical, but because the fabricator's shape was the right one and a
//! player who has used it already knows how to use this.

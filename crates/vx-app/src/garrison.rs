//! The bunkers, occupied: holders on the shelters, and the director that
//! paces them.
//!
//! # The loot loop grows teeth
//!
//! Bunkers have been free salvage since stage 19 — find the hatch, walk
//! down, strip the caches. Now every shelter is *held*: a squad derived
//! from the bunker's own seed, standing watch on its hatch, running the
//! same composure, cover and fire-discipline machinery the warrant's
//! deputies run. Same bunker, same holders, every session — the roster is
//! worldgen, like everything else about a shelter.
//!
//! # The director never tells the truth
//!
//! The hunt note's stalker discipline, landed early on the garrisons: what
//! a squad learns from *noise* — a shot, a working drill — is never a
//! position, only a zone. Hints are quantised to [`HINT_GRADE`]-metre cell
//! centres before the belief ever sees them, asserted at the interface, so
//! a garrison that heard you must still close the gap with the same
//! occupancy search as everyone else. Machines are loud: a dig site in
//! held country is a dinner bell, and the tension attaches to the mining
//! loop rather than to a haunted corridor.
//!
//! # Pairs, bounded on purpose
//!
//! Squad tactics are exactly two rules, as the people note prescribed:
//! pairs move alternately — one moves while one watches — and a pair that
//! loses its partner takes the ally-down composure hit, which `rake`
//! already charges. Suppression arcs and command layers are out of scope,
//! and the morale system generates enough behaviour to read without them.
//!
//! # Live-only, like every reaction to the player
//!
//! Holders never touch a block, their rounds damage you and not the world,
//! and a cleared shelter is session state. Nothing here reaches the replay
//! oracle, and the journal never learns a bunker was held.

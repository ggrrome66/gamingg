//! The chain between a bounty and a posse.
//!
//! # The middle was missing
//!
//! Stage 11 gave the frontier a bounty sheet and stage 28 gave it deputies,
//! and the join between them was one comparison:
//! `bounty >= WARRANT_THRESHOLD` and four armed men appeared over the hill.
//! Crossing a hundred credits of fines went from *nothing at all* to a
//! firefight, with no step in between and nobody's decision in the middle of
//! it.
//!
//! The civic note is specific about what belongs there: "when an individual's
//! bounty crosses a threshold, the sheriff cannot act alone — they must
//! obtain a **warrant from the mayor**, and only then may dispatch the
//! offender", with the consequences short of force being "fines, revoked
//! market access".
//!
//! # The mayor is a person, and that is the point
//!
//! [`crate::office`] says who holds the seat, and that person has an
//! archetype off [`crate::people`] and an opinion of you off
//! [`crate::disposition`]. So the decision has an author: a `Proud` mayor
//! signs because the law is the law, a `Craven` one stalls because signing
//! means consequences, and a mayor you have been feeding gifts to for a
//! season will find reasons to leave the paperwork in a drawer.
//!
//! It buys **time, not impunity**. Past [`SIGNS_REGARDLESS`] — the price the
//! permits round put on a vault — nobody's friend gets a pass, because a
//! system where enough gifts make you untouchable is a system with no law in
//! it at all.
//!
//! # Deterministic, and outside the hash
//!
//! Nothing here edits a block. The decision is arithmetic on things both a
//! live session and a reload can see — the seat, the ledger, the bounty and
//! the tick — plus one hashed nudge for texture, so a reloaded save reaches
//! the same verdict rather than re-rolling it. What is *stored* is only the
//! towns that have a warrant open, which on a clean frontier is none of
//! them.

//! What the player can take, and what happens when they cannot take any more.
//!
//! # Live-only, like every other reaction to the player
//!
//! Health never reaches the replay oracle. The journal records *orders* and
//! the hash covers *ground*, and being shot is neither: it is a reaction to
//! where the player stood, exactly like a villager's panic, the roost's
//! attention or a contact mark. So this lives in its own small file beside
//! the wallet and the friendship ledger, and a replay re-runs the same
//! orders over the same world without ever learning that anybody was hit.
//!
//! # Quiet, then mend
//!
//! There is no medkit economy and this round does not invent one. Take a
//! round and the count drops; break contact and stay unhit for
//! [`QUIET_SECONDS`] and it climbs back, one hit at a time. That makes
//! *disengaging* the heal — which suits a game whose combat is a posse you
//! provoked and can still walk away from.
//!
//! # Down is arrested, not dead
//!
//! Falling to zero in front of the law ends with a fine, not a grave. The
//! crime systems have been building toward this since permits shipped:
//! crime raises bounty, bounty crosses the warrant threshold, the warrant
//! sends deputies, the deputies put you down, and being put down settles the
//! bill. Dying to something that is *not* the law waits for a round with
//! something else in it.

//! The game binary.
//!
//! Wires the world, chunk streaming, renderer and window together and runs the
//! frame loop. Two modes:
//!
//! - default: open a window and play.
//! - `--screenshot <path>`: render one frame offscreen and exit. Needs no
//!   display, so it works over SSH, in CI, and against a software Vulkan
//!   driver — and is how the whole stack gets smoke-tested without a GPU.

//! What an NPC can see, and what it remembers.
//!
//! Two ideas, deliberately separated. *Sight* is a world question and lives in
//! [`vx_world::sight`]; this module is the *policy* on top — who is worth
//! looking at, how long a sighting is remembered once it is out of view, and
//! how the cost of asking is kept flat as the cast grows.
//!
//! **Memory is the feature, not an optimisation.** An observer that forgets
//! the instant you break line of sight snaps its head away the moment you step
//! behind a tree, which looks broken. One that keeps watching where you *were*
//! for a few seconds reads as a person who saw something — and it is exactly
//! the shape a hostile will need later to hunt rather than to twitch.
//!
//! The cost control falls out of the same mechanism: only one observer
//! re-casts per update, and between its turns it faces the remembered
//! position. Three villagers today and thirty later cost the same per frame.

//! What a squad *believes* about where you are — and the search that
//! belief turns into.
//!
//! # A belief, not a position
//!
//! Omniscient hostiles are unbeatable and boring; blind ones are furniture.
//! The middle is a belief: a last-known position with a confidence that
//! decays, which is exactly the model the kestrel's contact marks already
//! give the *player*. The symmetry is the point. Their intelligence about
//! you goes stale the way yours goes stale about them, breaking line of
//! sight means the same thing on both sides of a fight, and stealth becomes
//! a system rather than a stat.
//!
//! # Search is an occupancy map, and the map is the behaviour
//!
//! From the last-known position, probability spreads each tick to the
//! neighbouring cells that can be walked. Searchers move to the highest
//! cell they can reach; every cell they can see is zeroed. The mass flows
//! away from where they have looked and pools where they have not, and the
//! result *is* intelligent search — sweeping a room, covering an exit,
//! doubling back — with no scripted search points and no cheating, because
//! the map cannot send a searcher somewhere the player provably is not.
//!
//! When the total falls below [`GIVE_UP`] the search is over, and giving up
//! is visible: the caller lowers weapons, says so, and goes back to patrol.
//!
//! # Deterministic, and outside the oracle
//!
//! Plain grid arithmetic over a fixed-size board, so two runs fed the same
//! sightings search identically. Like every other reaction to the player it
//! is live-only: nothing here touches a block, so the replay oracle never
//! learns that anybody went looking.

//! Deputies: what the warrant sends after you, and how they behave.
//!
//! # Composure is the interesting variable, not aim
//!
//! The Ready or Not lesson, taken whole: what the player reads and plays
//! against is not marksmanship, it is *nerve*. Each deputy holds a scalar
//! composure; events push it down; thresholds move them between modes. Death
//! is one ending — flight, hiding and surrender are the others, and the last
//! one lands in a game that already has warrants, a bounty counter and a
//! fine waiting for it.
//!
//! # One derivation, spent twice
//!
//! Their nerve is the `nerve` byte [`crate::people::Temperament`] derived
//! back when the townsfolk shipped, and their archetype is the same one that
//! decides how chatty they are at a counter. A `Proud` deputy will not
//! surrender and a `Craven` one never bothers repositioning. Character was
//! rolled once, at creation, and this is the second thing to read it — which
//! is why "unpredictable" hostiles stay perfectly deterministic.
//!
//! # Intelligence the player cannot perceive is wasted
//!
//! Every mode transition lands a *bark* through the same toast-and-terminal
//! channel the townsfolk talk on. A squad that sweeps a room in silence may
//! as well be moving at random; the same squad saying "check the far side"
//! is the cleverest thing in the game. Half of AI quality is theatre, and
//! theatre is cheap.
//!
//! # Live-only, and the law does not shoot the scenery
//!
//! Like villagers, the roost and contact marks, none of this reaches the
//! replay oracle: deputies react to where the player is, and reactions are
//! not orders. Their rounds damage *you* and never the world — which is also
//! the honest fiction, since property damage is precisely what they are
//! billing you for.
